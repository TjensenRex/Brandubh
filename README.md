An old game that I thought I'd try to recreate with C++ programming.
The game is played between two people. The program prompts you each turn to think about your move and indicate whther your planned move is vertical or horizontal. It then asks for the coordinates of the piece you want to move and returns what you have selected, asking for the Y or X coordinate you are moving it to. If it is not the right piece, type "7" to restart the process. Play continues until the King is captured or reaches the edge of the board.
